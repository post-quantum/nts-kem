 ================================================================
 The purpose of this source file is to demonstrate a readable and compact
 implementation of all the Keccak instances approved in the FIPS 202 standard,
 including the hash functions and the extendable-output functions (XOFs).
 We focused on clarity and on source-code compactness,
 rather than on the performance.
 The advantages of this implementation are:
 + The source code is compact, after removing the comments, that is. :-)
 + There are no tables with arbitrary constants.
 + For clarity, the comments link the operations to the specifications using
 the same notation as much as possible.
 + There is no restriction in cryptographic features. In particular,
 the SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 XOFs can produce any output length.
 + The code does not use much RAM, as all operations are done in place.
 The drawbacks of this implementation are:
 - There is no message queue. The whole message must be ready in a buffer.
 - It is not optimized for peformance.
 The implementation is even simpler on a little endian platform. Just define the
 LITTLE_ENDIAN symbol in that case.
